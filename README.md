Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development and maintenance of software. It aids in the efficient delivery of solutions to technological issues and product development

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
First, the development of software engineering as a discipline to curb issues of increasing complexity of software systems in the 1960s.
Second, The rise of object-oriented programming in the 1980s that focused on modelling real-world entities as objects.
Third, agile methodologies in the 2000s that challenged traditional waterfall models by emphasizing iterative development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis - Defining the project's goals and objectives
2. Design - This entails creating a blueprint of the software system and designing the software architecture by developing the user interface and interactions
3. Development - This is where the actual code is written based on the design
4. Testing - This is where you test out and fix bugs in the code
5. Deployment - Releasing the software to the end users
6. Maintenance - Providing support and updates and fixing bugs and issues reported by users

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving to the next while the agile methodology employs an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration and rapid delivery of the working software.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for creating, testing and maintaining software applications. The quality assuarance engineer on the other hand ensures the quality of software is up to standard by testing it for defects while  a project manager oversees the entire software development from inception to its release to the market

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important as they provide comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. Examples include: Code editor like Visual Studio Code for writing and editing code
Version Control Systems on the other hand, help software teams manage changes to source code over time. examples include Git and Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. One of the challenges is the rapid technological advancement. this can be remedied by continuous learning on the engineers part
2. Meeting deadlines is another challenge but it can be easily sorted by effective time management, prioritization and breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable units

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is the lowest level of testing and it focuses on individual units of the software. Its importance is in identifying defects in the early stages of development
Integration testing tests how different software modules or components interact with each other and thus ensures that components woork seamlessly together and that data flows correcly between them
System testing evaluates the complete integrated system to ensure it meets specified requirements. This is important as it verifies that the system functions expected under various conditons and scenarios.
Acceptance testing is the final phase where the software is tested by the end user to determine if it meets their requirements. It is important in validating the software in meeting the needs as intended

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective instructions to guide an AI model in generating desired outputs. It is important as it gives users more control and direction

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about cows" this prompt is vague because it does not specify what it is we intend to know about cows
An improved prompt would be "List two cow breeds in Africa and briefly describe their characteristics"
The improved prompt is more effective because it explicitly states the desired outcome.
